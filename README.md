Figurl views used by neurosift and neurosift chat.

Each view is a separate vite project/directory, with all the source code living inside that directory, and I'd like to keep it that way. Of course there is going to be shared source code. Rather than making libraries, each project has a shared/ directory where this code lives. It is duplicated, but the intention is to keep these in sync. But it's not the end of the world if they go out of sync for periods... because it's really convenient to be able to edit those files within the context of working on a particular project. But then once things stabilize, they can be brought back into sync by simply copying files and making sure things compile. This avoids all kinds of issues that arise from trying to keep links consistent. There are also big advantages of keeping each view as a separate project that is deployed to a separate location in the cloud.
